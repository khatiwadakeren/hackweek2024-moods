      "body": "Sentry doesn't permit cancellations, which is deceptive, frustrating, and dishonest. Thankfully, I have connections with lawyers who specialize in class-action lawsuits, so I could: Initiate a class-action lawsuit against Sentry for blocking cancellations. Accuse Sentry of a financial crime for unauthorized charges on my credit card and continuous billing. Report Sentry's unlawful actions to federal authorities like the FTC. Notify shareholders about Sentryâ€™s questionable practices, as many may be unable to cancel their subscriptions "
